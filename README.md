# FRB Taiwanese Kana

This is a Taiwanese kana font, originally meant to accompany my Unicode proposal, *A proposal to encode Taiwanese kana in the UCS*.

It supports vertical layout, ruby, and all of the Taiwanese kana. The codepoints it uses are subject to change; see [the draft proposal for a list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ujlVRAn5tTpCx-4rq4US4vICC7G1erK/view).
